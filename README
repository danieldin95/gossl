ssl is a 100% incomplete go library for interfacing with the venerable
openssl library. It currently provides a hash.Hash sha256 implementation
backed by openssl.

Also included are a couple command line utilities for hashing files and strings.
They should run as fast as an equivalant c program (sha256sum).


#instructions

Make sure you have libssl-dev and libssl1.0.0 installed on your system.
This is needed to link against openssl.
This is a standard go package, so you should be able to just:
go install ssl hashfile hashstring

hashfile /etc/hosts
hashstring 'something'
